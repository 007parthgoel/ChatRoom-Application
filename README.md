This is web application build on Node.js where multiple users can group chat in private chatrooms.

We focused on following set of requirements while creating this application.

1.	Creating a responsive layout to support devices with different screen resolution.
2.	The list of users in a chatroom should be displayed.
3.	Users can send their current GPS location.
4.	Messages in a particular chatroom are not visible in other chatrooms.
